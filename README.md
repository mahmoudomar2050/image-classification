Cat Image Classification project 
I started my project with a two-layer multi-perceptron neural network,  70% model accuracy was obtained at test data, then I observed in the data that a few types of images the model tends to do poorly on include: Cat body in an unusual position, Cat appears against a background of a similar color, Unusual cat color, and species, Camera Angle, Brightness of the picture, Scale variation (the cat is very large or small in image), so I modified my model design to be four-layer deeper model such that it can capture deeper representations of the data and a 80% model accuracy was obtained at test data,  the baseline error state that there is more to do so I change the model type to be convolutional model with 11 layer as follows,( conv layer with 32 filter of size 3*3, max-pooling layer with 2*2 filter, conv layer with 64 filter of size 3*3, max-pooling layer with 2*2 filter, conv layer with 128 filter of size 3*3, max-pooling layer with 2*2 filter, 512 unit dense layer with relu activation, one unit dense layer with sigmoid activation) 82% model accuracy was obtained at test data, the result was not good enough so I decided to fine tune the VG16 model and a 97% model accuracy was obtained at test data.
